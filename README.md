# CO2 Footprint in Agriculture

## Dataset Overview
Dataset obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset-forecasting-ml

This dataset contains **7,000 rows** and **31 columns**, capturing emissions and other agricultural data from **1990 to 2020** for each country. The columns represent various features related to agricultural CO2 emissions, including emissions from activities such as crop residues, rice cultivation, food transport, as well as environmental and demographic factors like population data and forestland coverage.

All emissions are recorded in **kilotonnes (kt)**, where **1 kt = 1000 kg** of CO2.

This dataset is will be for understanding the impact of agriculture on climate change.

## Dataset Features
The dataset contains the following key features:

- **Savanna Fires**: Emissions from fires in savanna ecosystems.
- **Forest Fires**: Emissions from fires in forested areas.
- **Crop Residues**: Emissions from burning or decomposing leftover plant material after crop harvesting.
- **Rice Cultivation**: Emissions from methane released during rice cultivation.
- **Drained Organic Soils (CO2)**: Emissions from carbon dioxide released when draining organic soils.
- **Pesticides Manufacturing**: Emissions from the production of pesticides.
- **Food Transport**: Emissions from transporting food products.
- **Forestland**: Land covered by forests (carbon sink, negative emissions).
- **Net Forest Conversion**: Change in forest area due to deforestation and afforestation.
- **Food Household Consumption**: Emissions from food consumption at the household level.
- **Food Retail**: Emissions from the operation of retail establishments selling food.
- **On-farm Electricity Use**: Electricity consumption on farms.
- **Food Packaging**: Emissions from the production and disposal of food packaging materials.
- **Agrifood Systems Waste Disposal**: Emissions from waste disposal in the agri-food system.
- **Food Processing**: Emissions from processing food products.
- **Fertilizers Manufacturing**: Emissions from the production of fertilizers.
- **IPPU**: Emissions from industrial processes and product use.
- **Manure Applied to Soils**: Emissions from applying animal manure to agricultural soils.
- **Manure Left on Pasture**: Emissions from animal manure on pasture or grazing land.
- **Manure Management**: Emissions from managing and treating animal manure.
- **Fires in Organic Soils**: Emissions from fires in organic soils.
- **Fires in Humid Tropical Forests**: Emissions from fires in humid tropical forests.
- **On-farm Energy Use**: Energy consumption on farms.
- **Rural Population**: Number of people living in rural areas.
- **Urban Population**: Number of people living in urban areas.
- **Total Population - Male**: Total number of male individuals in the population.
- **Total Population - Female**: Total number of female individuals in the population.
- **Total Emission**: Total greenhouse gas emissions from various sources.
- **Average Temperature (Â°C)**: The average yearly increase in temperature in degrees Celsius (target for machine learning models).

## Area of Application
This dataset has multiple applications in the following areas:

1. **Climate Change Research**: Understanding the impact of agriculture on climate change by tracking CO2 emissions from various agricultural practices.
2. **Emissions Forecasting**: Using machine learning to forecast future emissions, providing valuable insights for policymakers and researchers working on climate mitigation strategies.
3. **Sustainable Agriculture**: Identifying emission hotspots in the agri-food sector to develop strategies for reducing the environmental impact of farming and food production.
4. **Environmental Policy**: Assisting governments and organizations in setting targets and regulations to reduce CO2 emissions in the agricultural sector.
5. **Carbon Sequestration**: Understanding the role of forests and other carbon sinks in offsetting emissions, contributing to strategies such as afforestation and reforestation.
